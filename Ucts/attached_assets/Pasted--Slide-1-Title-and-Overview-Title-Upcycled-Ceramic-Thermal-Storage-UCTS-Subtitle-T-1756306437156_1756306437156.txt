# Slide 5: Competitive Advantage
- **Title**: Why UCTS Stands Out
- **Content**:
  | Technology              | Cost ($/kWh) | Eco-Friendliness | Scalability |
  |-------------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
  | Lithium-Ion Batteries   | 150–250      | Low              | Medium      |
  | Sand Batteries          | 10–20        | High             | Low         |
  | Standard Ceramics       | 50–100       | Medium           | High        |
  | **UCTS**                | **13.6**     | **High**         | **High**    |
  - Edge: Lowest cost, waste-based, scalable solution.
